# Simplix AI — Learn your way! 🧩

**Simplix AI** is a powerful **Chrome Extension** that transforms how you interact with web content. Unlike standard AI tools that read an entire page, Simplix allows you to visually **crop** specific sections of a website—text, charts, or code—and process them through specialized AI modes.

> **Context is King.** Select exactly what you want the AI to see, and convert it into summaries, stories, exams, or simplified explanations instantly.

## 🚀 Why Simplix is Unique
* **Visual Context Injection:** Don't rely on the AI guessing what part of the page matters. Use the **Crop Tool** to draw a box around the exact content you want to analyze.
* **Multi-Modal Output:** Transform the same text into a bedtime story, a university-level exam, or a corporate summary with one click.
* **Interactive Overlays:** Results aren't just text; they are rendered in draggable, floating windows. The Exam mode features a fully interactive quiz interface with real-time scoring.
* **Auto-Scroll Cropping:** Need to select a long article? The crop tool automatically scrolls the page as you drag, capturing content off-screen.
* **Integrated Chatbot:** After generating a result, a context-aware **SimplixBot** pops up, allowing you to ask specific follow-up questions about the cropped text.
